# Clase del Lunes 09/12/2019


[Line Delimited JSON (JDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON), newline-delimited **JSON** (**NDJSON**), and **JSON lines** (**JSONL**) are three terms for equivalent formats of JSON streaming.

Streaming makes use of the fact that the JSON format does not allow newline and return characters within primitive values (in strings those must be escaped as `\n` and `\r`, respectively) and that most JSON formatters default to not including any whitespace, including newlines and returns.
These features allow the <u>newline</u> and/or return characters to be used as a delimiter.

This format is documented at the [JSON Lines website](http://jsonlines.org/).

This example shows two JSON objects (the implicit newline characters at the end of each line are not shown):

```json
{"some":"thing\n"}
```

```json
{"may":{"include":"nested","objects":["and","arrays"]}}
```

The use of a newline as a delimiter enables this format to work very well with [traditional line-oriented Unix tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)).
