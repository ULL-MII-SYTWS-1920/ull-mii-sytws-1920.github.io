GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

With GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository. GitHub Actions powers GitHub's built-in continuous integration service. 

Workflows run in Linux, macOS, Windows, and containers on GitHub-hosted servers. You can create workflows using actions defined in your repository, open source actions in a public repository on GitHub, or a published Docker container image. Workflows in forked repositories don't run by default.
