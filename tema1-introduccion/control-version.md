# Software Development Cycle

## Git Subm贸dulos. Repos con varios Subproyectos

A la hora de hacer un paquete para npm es conveniente tener un repositorio cliente de prueba. Esto nos lleva a crear 
un macro-repo que consiste en el repo del m贸dulo y en el programa de uso.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

With GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository. GitHub Actions powers GitHub's built-in continuous integration service. 

Workflows run in Linux, macOS, Windows, and containers on GitHub-hosted servers. You can create workflows using actions defined in your repository, open source actions in a public repository on GitHub, or a published Docker container image. Workflows in forked repositories don't run by default.

## GitHub Package Registry

GitHub Package Registry is a software package hosting service, similar to npmjs.org, rubygems.org, or hub.docker.com, that allows you to host your packages and code in one place. You can host software packages privately or publicly and use them as dependencies in your projects.
