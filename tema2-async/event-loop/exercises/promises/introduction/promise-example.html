    <p>A <code>Promise</code> object represents a value that may not
    be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in future. It
    allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion.
    <br/>
    For example, if you use the Promise API to make an asynchronous
    call to a remote web service you will create a <code>Promise</code>
    object which represents the data that will be returned by the web
    service in future. The caveat being that the actual data is not
    available yet. It will become available when the request completes
    and a response comes back from the web service. In the meantime the
    <code>Promise</code> object acts like a proxy to the actual data.
    Further, you can attach callbacks to the <code>Promise</code> object
    which will be called once the actual data is available ...</p>

    Simply refresh the page to view a new random joke. Also, open up
    your browser console so that you can see the order in which the
    different parts of the code are executed. Also, note that a
    <code>Promise</code> can have three states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pending (not fulfilled or rejected)</li>
      <li>fulfilled</li>
      <li>rejected</li>
    </ul>
<p>The <code>Promise.status</code> property, which is code-inaccessible and private, gives information about these states. Once a Promise is rejected or fulfilled, this status gets permanently associated with it. This means a Promise can succeed or fail only once. If the Promise has already been fulfilled and later you attach a <code>then()</code> to it with two callbacks the success callback will be correctly called. So, in the world of Promises, we are not interested in knowing when the Promise is settled. We are only concerned with the final outcome of the Promise.</p>
