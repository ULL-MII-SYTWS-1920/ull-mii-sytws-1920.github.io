## Creating a React App

This page describes a few popular React toolchains (like create-react-app, [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)) which help with tasks like:

- Scaling to many files and components.
- Using third-party libraries from npm.
- Detecting common mistakes early.
- Live-editing CSS and JS in development.
- Optimizing the output for production.

### For a Web App

The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

## React Function Components

* [React Function Components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component#react-function-component-lifecycle)

>In the past, there have been various React Component Types, but with the introduction of React Hooks it's possible to write your entire application with just functions as React components.

>This in-depth guide shows you everything about React Function Components -- which are basically just JavaScript Functions being React Components which return JSX (React's Syntax) -- so that after you have read this tutorial you should be well prepared to implement modern React applications with them.

## React Router

### The Problem

The biggest difference of Single Page Apps (SPA) with traditional multi-page apps is that navigating a single-page app doesn't involve going to an entirely new page. Instead, your pages (commonly known as **views** in this context) typically load inline within the same page itself.

When you are loading content inline, things get a little challenging. The hard part is not loading the content itself. That is relatively easy. The hard part is making sure that single-page apps behave in a way that is consistent with what your users are used to. More specifically, when users navigate your app, they expect that:

1. The URL displayed in the address bar always reflects the thing that they are viewing.
2. They can use the browser's back and forward buttons...successfully.
3. They can navigate to a particular view (aka deep link) directly using the appropriate URL.

With multi-page apps, these three things come for free. There is nothing extra you have to do for any of it. With single-page apps, because you aren't navigating to an entirely new page, you have to do real work to deal with these three things that your users expect to just work.

To deal with all of this, you have a bucket full of techniques commonly known as **routing**.
