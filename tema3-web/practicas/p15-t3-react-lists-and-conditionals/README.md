# Descripci칩n de la pr치ctica p15-t3-react-lists-and-conditionals

1.  Introduce an `input` field inside the `App` component with a `change` listener which ouputs in a paragraph the entered text
2. Introduce a `ValidationComponent` which receives the `length`of the entered text as a `prop`.
3. The `ValidationComponent` should conditionally output `Text too short` or `Text long enough` in a paragraph dpeneding whether the text length is less than or greater than some number, let us say 5.
4. Create another component `CharComponent` with a `div` and style it as a inline box. Here is a suggestion:
  ```css
{
    display: inline-box;
    padding: 16px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 16px;
    border: 1px solid black;
}
  ```
5. Inside the `App`component render a list of `CharComponent`, where each `CharComponent` receives - as a `prop` - a different letter of the entered  text from the initial `input` field
6. When you click a `CharCompoment`it should be removed
